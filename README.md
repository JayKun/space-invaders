<h1>Space Invaders and Snake</h1>
A classic space invaders games but with a twist. Instead of keyboard inputs, a player conrtols the movement of the ship using a wireless gyroscopic controller

<h2>Deploy</h2>
1. Both versions of the game are deployed to my personal server:
<a href="junkaiong.com/play/games/index.html">
Space Invaders Motion
</a>
<a href="junkaiong.com/play/games/index.html?fileName=space_invaders_motion.js">
Classic Space Invader
</a>

2. You could also run the games yourself by downloading the files along with the p5.js libraries.
