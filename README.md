<h1>Space Invaders and Snake</h1>
<h2>A classic space invaders games but with a twist. Instead of keyboard inputs, a player conrtols the movement of the ship using a wireless gyroscopic controller
</h2>

<h2>Deploy</h2>
1. Both versions of the game are deployed to my personal server:
<code>
junkaiong.com/play/games/index.html
junkaiong.com/play/games/index.html?fileName=space_invaders_motion.js
</code>

2. You could also run the games yourself by downloading the files along with the p5.js libraries.
